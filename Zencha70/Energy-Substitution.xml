		<prerequisite>The ability to cast at least one spell</prerequisite>
		<requirements>[type:spell]</requirements>
		<description>
			<p>When you gain this feat, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. Your extensive study of magic of that damage type yields the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Increase your spellcasting ability score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
				<li>When you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can change the damage to the chosen type. Your GM may decide that some spell effects change when the damage type changes. For example, a cold fireball would not set objects on fire, but it might extinguish flames in the area. You may select this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different damage type.</li>
