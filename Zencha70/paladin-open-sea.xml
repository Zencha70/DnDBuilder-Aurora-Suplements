		<description>
			<p>The Oath of the Open Sea calls to seafaring warriors, swashbuckling sailors, and traveling guardians who seek the thrill of a limitless horizon. Driven to search for adventure and mystery across and beneath every endless oceanic expanse, paladins who swear this oath stand against those who would deny liberty to likeminded travelers, rooting out tyranny and corruption wherever it is found. Such guardians believe in the natural beauty of the sea, often making offerings and prayers to entities or deities such as the Wildmother or the Stormlord who influence safe passage. At the same time, they answer the call to hunt the monstrous creatures that too often bloody the waters with wanton violence and ill intent, and which terrorize the folk of the sea and shore.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Tenets of the Open Sea</h5>
			<p>The tenets of the Oath of The Open Sea drive a paladin to push themselves far into the unkown, and to face any threat they may find there with the might of the oceans and its storms</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>No Greater Life than a Life Lived Free.</em></strong> One should be free to chart their own path without oppression. Those who would exert their power to dominate others shall be smote.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Trust the Skies.</em></strong> The guidance of a strong breeze. The rumbling warnings of a coming storm. Nature is a source of portent and council that should be heeded.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Adapt like the Water.</em></strong> The waters of the ocean can shift around any obstacle or become an impassable one. They can carve around and reveal the secrets of the past or swallow the truth and hide it forever. To embrace this fluidity is to be ready for any challenge.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Explore the Uncharted.</em></strong> The world is filled with much mystery. Through the pursuit of these enigmatic ends, one can both uncover those who hide their dark deeds in shadow to be judged, and find the path to becoming something great.</p>

			<p><em>3rd-level Oath of the Open Sea feature</em></p>
			<p>You gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Marine Layer.</em></strong> As an action, you channel the sea to create a thick cloud of fog that surrounds you for 20 feet in all directions. The fog moves with you, remaining centered on you and making its area heavily obscured. You and each creature within 5 feet of you instead treat the area as lightly obscured. This fog lasts for 10 minutes, spreads around corners, and cannot be dispersed unless you choose to end this effect (no action required).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Fury of the Tides.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you channel the powerful might of the waves to bolster your attacks for 1 minute. Once per turn for the duration, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can choose to push the target 10 feet away from you. If pushed into an obstacle or another creature, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>
